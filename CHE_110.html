        <div id="B9">
            Rainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity, from systems that can be installed with minimal skills, to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation. The basic rainwater harvesting system is more of a plumbing job than a technical job, as all the outlets from the building's terrace are connected through a pipe to an underground tank that stores water. There are common components that are installed in such systems, such as pre-filters (see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_filter">vortex filter</a>), drains/gutters, storage containers, and depending on whether the system is pressurized, also pumps, and treatment devices such as UV lights, chlorination devices and post-filtration equipment.<br>Systems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption. Specifically, the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain an adequate flow of water. The water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured water. For low-tech systems, many low-tech methods are used to capture rainwater: rooftop systems, surface water capture, and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it in tanks (cisterns).

        <div id="B12">
            Rainwater harvesting provides the independent water supply during regional water restrictions, and in developed countries, it is often used to supplement the main supply. It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. Rainwater harvesting increases the availability of water during dry seasons by increasing the levels of dried borewells and wells. Surface water supply is readily available for various purposes thus reducing dependence on underground water. It improves the quality of ground by diluting salinity. It does not cause pollution and is environmentally friendly. It is cost-effective and easily affordable. It also helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts. Applications of rainwater harvesting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_urban_water_management">urban water system</a> provides a substantial benefit for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply">water supply</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater">wastewater</a> subsystems by reducing the need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution">clean water</a> in water distribution systems, less generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormwater">stormwater</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewer_system">sewer systems,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and a reduction in stormwater runoff polluting freshwater bodies.<br>A large body of work has focused on the development of life cycle assessment and its costing methodologies to assess the level of environmental impacts and money that can be saved by implementing rainwater harvesting systems.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-inh-21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>

        <h3>Independent water supply [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rainwater_harvesting&action=edit&section=10">edit</a>]</h3>
        <div id="B13">
            Rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during water restrictions. In areas where clean water is costly, or difficult to come by, rainwater harvesting is a critical source of clean water. In developed countries, rainwater is often harvested to be used as a supplemental source of water rather than the main source, but the harvesting of rainwater can also decrease a household's water costs or overall usage levels. Rainwater is safe to drink if the consumers do additional treatments before drinking. Boiling water helps to kill germs. Adding another supplement to the system such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_flush">first flush</a> diverter is also a common procedure to avoid contaminants of the water.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a><br>

        <h3>Supplement in drought [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rainwater_harvesting&action=edit&section=11">edit</a>]</h3>
        <div id="B14">
            When drought occurs, rainwater harvested in past months can be used. If rain is scarce but also unpredictable, the use of a rainwater harvesting system can be critical to capturing the rain when it does fall. Many countries with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running downhills. Even in periods of low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain">rainfall</a>, enough water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs and tanks can be constructed to hold large quantities of rainwater.<br>In addition, rainwater harvesting decreases the demand for water from wells, enabling groundwater levels to be further sustained rather than depleted.

With the idea that supply of rainwater not only saves the potable water but also saves the stormwater entering the combined sewer network (thereby requiring treatment), the savings in environmental emissions were higher if the buildings are connected to a combined sewer network compared to separate one.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Devkota_20152-25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>

        <div id="B16">
            Although standard RWH systems can provide a water source to developing regions facing poverty, the average cost for an RWH setup can be costly depending on the type of technology used. Governmental aid and NGOs can assist communities facing poverty by providing the materials and education necessary to develop and maintain RWH setups.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Cain-2014-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

            Some studies show that rainwater harvesting is a widely applicable solution for water scarcity and other multiple usages, owing to its cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Cain-2014-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Constructing new substantial, centralized water supply systems, such as dams, is prone to damage local ecosystems, generates external social costs, and has limited usages, especially in developing countries or impoverished communities. On the other hand, installing rainwater harvesting systems is verified by a number of studies to provide local communities a sustainable water source, accompanied by other various benefits, including protection from flood and control of water runoff, even in poor regions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Cain-2014-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Rainwater harvesting systems that do not require major construction or periodic maintenance by a professional from outside the community are more friendly to the environment and more likely to benefit the local people for a longer period of time.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Cain-2014-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>  Thus, rainwater harvesting systems that could be installed and maintained by local people have bigger chances to be accepted and used by more people.<br>
            The usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ">in-situ</a> technologies can reduce investment costs in rainwater harvesting. In-situ technologies for rainwater harvesting could be a feasible option for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area">rural areas</a> since less material is required to construct them. They can provide a reliable water source that can be utilized to expand agricultural outputs.

        <div id="B18">
            Rainwater harvesting is a widely used method of storing rainwater in countries presenting with drought characteristics. Several pieces of research have derived and developed different criteria and techniques to select suitable sites for harvesting rainwater. Some research was identified and selected suitable sites for the potential erection of dams, as well as derived a model builder in ArcMap 10.4.1. The model combined several parameters, such as slope, runoff potential, land cover/use, stream order, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_quality">soil quality</a>, and hydrology to determine the suitability of the site for harvesting rainwater.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-30"><sup>[30]</sup></a><br>
            Harvested water from RWH systems can be minimal during below-average precipitation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate">arid</a> urban regions such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a>. RWH is useful for developing areas as it collects water for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation">irrigation</a> and domestic purposes. However, the gathered water should be adequately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration">filtered</a> to ensure safe drinking.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-31"><sup>[31]</sup></a><br>

        <div id="B19">
            Rainwater may need to be analyzed properly, and used in a way appropriate to its safety. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu">Gansu</a> province, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_water_disinfection">solar water disinfection</a> is used by boiling harvested rainwater in parabolic solar cookers before being used for drinking.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>  These so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology">appropriate technology</a>" methods provide low-cost disinfection options for treatment of stored rainwater for drinking.<br>
            While rainwater itself is a clean source of water, often better than groundwater or water from rivers or lakes,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> the process of collection and storage often leaves the water polluted and non-potable. Rainwater harvested from roofs can contain human, animal and bird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces">feces,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss">mosses</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen">lichens,</a> windblown dust, particulates from urban pollution, pesticides, and inorganic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion">ions</a> from the sea (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium">Ca</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium">Mg</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium">Na</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium">K</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine">Cl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate">SO<sub>4</sub></a>), and dissolved gases (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide">NO<sub>x</sub></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_oxide">SO<sub>x</sub></a>). High levels of pesticide have been found in rainwater in Europe with the highest concentrations occurring in the first rain immediately after a dry spell;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Pearce-1999-34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> the concentration of these and other contaminants are reduced significantly by diverting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_flush">intial flow</a> of run-off water to waste. Improved water quality can also be obtained by using a floating draw-off mechanism (rather than from the base of the tank) and by using a series of tanks, withdraw from the last in series. Prefiltration is a common practice used in the industry to keep the system healthy and ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediments.<br>
            A concept of rainwater harvesting and cleaning it with solar energy for rural household drinking purposes has been developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbkar_Agricultural_Research_Institute">Nimbkar Agriculture Research Institute</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-Patange-2020-35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>

        <div id="B20">
            Conceptually, a water supply system should match the quality of water with the end-user. However, in most of the developed world, high-quality potable water is used for all end uses. This approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts on the environment. Supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for non-potable water uses, such as toilet flushing, irrigation, and laundry, may be a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy.<br>
            Rainwater cisterns can also act as habitat for pathogen-bearing mosquitoes. As a result, care must be taken to ensure that female mosquitoes can not access the cistern to lay eggs. Larvae eating fish can also be added to the cistern, or it can be chemically treated.

Many Canadians have started implementing rainwater harvesting systems for use in stormwater reduction, irrigation, laundry, and lavatory plumbing. Provincial and municipal legislation is in place for regulating the rights and uses for captured rainwater. Substantial reform to Canadian law since the mid-2000s has increased the use of this technology in agricultural, industrial, and residential use, but ambiguity remains amongst legislation in many provinces. Bylaws and local municipal codes often regulate rainwater harvesting.

            In the early 21st century, India began heavily investing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#India">rainwater harvestinng</a> infrastructure and policy as an urgent response to water scarcity.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>  In 2001, Tamil Nadu became the first Indian state to make rainwater harvesting compulsory in every building to avoid groundwater depletion. In Rajasthan, rainwater harvesting has traditionally been practiced by the people of the Thar Desert. Increase in rainwater harvesting efforts across the nation have revived ancient water harvesting systems in Rajasthan, such as the chauka system from the Jaipur district. Other large cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bangalore all have varying rules for mandatory rainwater harvesting, especially in new buildings. In 2002, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai required all new buildings over 1000 square meters to have rainwater harvesting infrastructure.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>

            The law was expanded in 2007 to 300 square meters. The goal was to ensure buildings had enough water to last them through non-monsoon seasons. The process included a catchment system, an initial flush, and extensive filtering. As of 2021, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihanmumbai_Municipal_Corporation">Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation</a> (BMC) reported 3000 newly constructed or redeveloped buildings with rainwater harvesting infrastructure.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting#cite_note-42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> However, many residents have complained that the stored water is contaminated, turning saline and brackish.
